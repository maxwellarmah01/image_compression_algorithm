# A high-level overview of an image compression algorithm:

1. Read and preprocess the image:
   - Load the image data into memory.
   - Convert the image to the desired color space, typically RGB.
   - Apply gamma correction if necessary.
   - Optionally, perform other transformations like color correction or filtering.

2. Choose the image representation:
   - Decide whether the image will be represented as a paletted (indexed) image or a truecolor image.
   - For paletted images:
     - Determine the optimal color palette to represent the image by quantizing the color space.
     - Map each pixel of the image to the corresponding index in the color palette.
   - For truecolor images:
     - Retain the actual RGB values for each pixel.

3. Perform filtering:
   - Apply filtering to each scanline of the image.
   - The filtering process predicts the pixel values based on neighboring pixels and calculates the differences (residuals).
   - Select the best filtering strategy for each scanline using heuristics such as the sum of absolute differences (SAD) or other metrics.
   - Encode the filtered residuals.

4. Compress the filtered data:
   - Use the Deflate compression algorithm, which combines LZ77 and Huffman coding.
   - Apply LZ77 compression to replace repeated sequences of data with references to earlier occurrences.
   - Generate Huffman codes for the different patterns and assign shorter codes to more frequently occurring patterns.
   - Compress the filtered data using Deflate, producing the compressed data stream.

5. Construct the file:
   - Create the file structure with necessary headers, metadata, and chunks.
   - Include chunks like IHDR (image header), PLTE (palette), tRNS (transparency), gAMA (gamma), and others as needed.
   - Write the compressed data stream into the IDAT (image data) chunk.
   - Add additional chunks such as ancillary chunks for additional data or text information.
   - Write the end-of-file marker to finalize the PNG file.

The resulting file contains the compressed image data, along with relevant metadata and optional chunks.
